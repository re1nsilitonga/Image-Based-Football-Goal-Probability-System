# Image-Based-Football-Goal-Probability-System
This project estimates goal probability, commonly referred to as expected goals (xG), from a football shot situation using 2D image processing and geometric modeling. The system employs homography transformation, singular value decomposition (SVD), and eigenvalue–eigenvector analysis to map shot frames onto a FIFA-standard field coordinate system.
