# Image-Based-Football-Goal-Probability-System
In modern football analytics, goal probability models usually rely on rich spatiotemporal tracking data, multiple synchronized cameras, or wearable sensors, which are expensive and inaccessible for amateur teams and casual analysis. This paper presents a system that estimates the probability of scoring a goal from a single still image of a shooting situation by combining concepts from geometric algebra and linear algebra. Perspective image coordinates are mapped to a metric two-dimensional pitch coordinate system through an affine basis transformation calibrated from the goal posts and ball position. Lateral distances with respect to the shooting line are computed directly using the wedge product as the signed area of a parallelogram, allowing the perpendicular distance to be obtained without explicit rotation matrices. The spatial configuration of defenders is modeled through covariance analysis and eigenvalue–eigenvector decomposition, which captures the dominant orientation of the defensive wall. The final goal probability is produced by a logistic regression model that incorporates distance, shooting angle, and a defensive pressure factor that accounts for both goalkeeper positioning and defender obstruction derived from eigen-analysis. The proposed approach demonstrates that single-image geometric reconstruction can approximate realistic goal probabilities while remaining consistent with the teaching material of Linear Algebra and Geometry.
